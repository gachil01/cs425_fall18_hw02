        <h2>Testimonials from Customers</h2>
        <p>"John did a fantastic job capturing my wedding--from the requisite 'formal' portraits to the candids that
            truly could never be staged. I received more compliments than I could count on the quality of the photos,
            and I am extremely happy with the images. Friends of mine told me that they paid thousands of dollars for
            photos that were not half as good as ours--both because the photographer was unable to capture the meaning
            of the wedding day and also because there was just not as much of a selection of photos. Aside from his
            photographic talent, John was a pure joy to work with. He is extremely professional and friendly. I highly
            recommend JD Photography." -Taylor and Dave </p>

        <p>"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! We couldn't be more pleased with the pictures. Peter and I feel as if
            weve just acquired treasured museum pieces."
            - Elizabeth</p>

        <p>"Thank you for your wonderful work and for your patience throughout the whole day. The pictures are
            perfect. We both appreciate the professionalism and style you brought to your work. Your images will stand
            forever as a treasured piece of our history together. Thank you
            - Jena and Jeff</p>

        <p>"We want to thank you so much for the wonderful pictures. We love how you captured so many special moments
            and the beauty of the day. The photography is such an important part of the monumental day for us and we
            couldnt be happier with your work. We cant thank you enough."
